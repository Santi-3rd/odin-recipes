<p>A Puerto Rican side, usually served with rice and beans in our family.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
    <li>3 plantains, peeled and sliced into 1-inch pieces</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>garlic powder to taste</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Place a few plantain slices in the oil, and cook until lightly golden in color, about three minutes. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining slices.</li>
    <li>While the plantain slices are still warm, place them one at a time between two sheets of wax paper, and flatten by hand to 1/4 inch thick. Return flattened slices to the skillet, and continue frying until golden brown. Drain on paper towels, and season with salt and garlic powder.</li>
